    "One thousand is a fun vocabulary quiz game. At the " +
    "beginning of the game you are given a readiness meter. " +
    "This meter determines how many of the essential words " +
    "to know for the GRE you have currently gotten correct " +
    "and mastered.  The point of the game is to master all " +
    "1000 essential words to know for the GRE. During each " +
    "round  you can gain up to five points. Every question " +
    "you get correct helps build your readiness meter. Try " +
    "to build your score as high as possible and your readiness " +
    "meter to 100% to master all 1000 words. If you would like " +
    "to practice without a timer, you can use practice mode, " +
    "and when you are ready you can use play mode to gain points " +
    "and build your ready meter. If you would like to review " +
    "words you have previously missed or haven't yet mastered, " +
    "you can use review mode. Good Luck!",
